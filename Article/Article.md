## HOW THE WEB WORKS AND WEB PROTOCOLS, AND HOW POPULAR SERVICES ARE IMPLEMENTED ON THE WEB

When scrolling through Pinterest, or listening to the hottest new playlist on YouTube have you ever stopped to wonder what goes on behind the screens and these sites that we see? How does a complete website open in a matter of seconds once you click a link, and how is it possible to stream a sports event in real time?

If this is you (I mean why else would you be reading this article?), allow me to explain the different technologies that come into play to create the web and its services that you know today.

HOW THE WEB WORKS AND ITS ARCHITECTURE

The Web is a system of interconnected documents and resources accessible through the internet. Web architecture refers to the complete structure of a web application, its design, implementation and deployment.


Web application architecture
Modern web application architecture is typically implemented with a 3-tier structure:

Presentation layer: This is the user interface of the web application. It is responsible for the visual aspects of the web application, such as the design of the user interface, the layout of the screens, and the navigation.
Application layer: This is the business logic layer. It is responsible for the logic and processes that the web application needs to perform. This includes the processing of user input, data manipulation, and the execution of business rules. One or multiple web servers live within the application layer.
Data layer: This layer is responsible for the persistent data storage and the retrieval of data when needed. It is typically composed of a database and other data stores such as files and web services. It’s worth noting that the data layer could have one or multiple databases, depending on the exact architecture.
The 3-tier structure is important because it helps to separate the different elements of a software application. By separating these components, the application can be designed to be more efficient and secure. It also makes it easier to maintain and extend over time.

Web architecture is important because it functions as the foundation for each element of a digital application or program. Since it’s foundational, the quality of the architecture often directly impacts the quality of the finished product.

NETWORK PROTOCOLS AND THEIR ROLES IN THE WEB

Network protocols serve as a set of rules for formatting and processing data, enabling devices to communicate with each other over the internet. Ensuring that data is sent, received and well understood between different systems.

HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)/ HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)

HTTP Protocol is used to transfer hypertexts over the internet. It sets the precedent for how information needs to be formatted and transmitted. Also, the actions in which browsers respond to requests made by a user to access specific web pages.

HTTPS protocol on the other hand acts as an extension of HTTP. It helps with deal with sensitive data and information by encrypting and securing it from third party access.

HyperText Markup Language (HTML):

HTML is the basic scripting language used by web browsers to create and structure content on the web. It tells the browser how texts, images and other forms of multimedia should be displayed on a webpage.


Basic HTML code displaying the layout structure of a webpage
It makes use of HTML tags and elements. Elements are the opening and closing tags as well as the content within, while tags are keywords with semantic meaning which the browser understands. The browser then displays a visual layout of the html structure.

Domain Name System (DNS):

Every computer as well as other devices that is internet accessible has a unique IP address which other machines use to find this device. When you open a web browser, rather than having to and enter long series of numbers to access a webpage, you simply type in a domain name, e.g. “youtube.com” (Imagine having to memorize every single IP address).

The Domain Name System translates human readable names into the IP address needed for devices to locate and connect to each other. The Domain Name System is a hierarchical and distributed name service that provides a naming system for computers, services, and other resources on the Internet or Internet Protocol networks.

(It’s basically a phonebook for the web!)

SERVICES IMPLEMENTED BY THE WEB

The internet is the global connectivity of different kind of computers. A web service is a standardized way for client and server applications to communicate over the World Wide Web. The client that called the web service would be able to access its functionalities.

A web service is a collection of open standards and protocols that facilitate data sharing between various systems or applications. Programs built in several different programming languages can use web services.

Popular web services include E-commerce, social media, etc.

E-COMMERCE SERVICE

Electronic commerce, or e-commerce, is the buying and selling of goods and services over the internet. E-commerce can be conducted on computers, tablets, smartphones, and other smart devices.

Most E-commerce takes place on an E-commerce website, which acts as a virtual storefront wherein transactions and commerce can take place. E-commerce can manifest in many different forms:

Retail: Products sold directly to an end-level consumer without intermediary involvement.

Wholesale: Products sold in bulk, directly to the consumer, or to wholesalers.

Dropshipping: Products are sold online but shipped directly to the consumer by a third-party managing inventory and other logistics.

Digital Products: Most people think about tangible products, but many eCommerce transactions include the sale of digital products, such as music, movies, audio and video files, templates, software, etc.)

What is an E-commerce website?

E-commerce websites are the digital portals (i.e. virtual storefronts) that facilitate E-commerce. Remember, E-commerce is a blanket term that includes virtually any transaction that takes place on the internet.

Historically, the earliest E-commerce transactions took place via email and phone calls.

Even at the earliest stages of development, effective E-commerce websites must be designed to:

- Maximizing the aggregate quantity of transactions.

- Maximizing “average order value.”

- Steering shoppers to the most profitable products and categories.

- Encouraging brand loyalty, repeat customers, audience engagement.

- Streamlining checkout and other critical conversion funnels.

E-commerce websites range from template-driven plug-and-play shopping carts to complex E-commerce websites that cost millions of dollars to develop and maintain.

How do E-commerce websites work?

E-commerce websites work through a series of steps, utilizing website code, the database, and 3rd party applications such as a payment processor or payment gateway.

E-commerce websites use SSL certificates to secure and encrypt all transferred data (Remember when we talked about HTTPS!). Sensitive data, including credit card information, should never be stored within the website’s database unless the website adheres to all mandated regulations.

Popular e-commerce platforms include: Shopify, Onveos, Magento, etc.

Popular e-commerce websites include: Amazon.com, Jumia.com, Temu.com, etc.

In summary, the web is a system of protocols, technologies, and services that work together to provide services, functionality, accessibility across the internet. Every component, from the fundamental architecture that divides the presentation, application, and data layers to the communication-facilitating protocols like HTTP, HTTPS, and DNS as well as other network protocols, is essential to producing flawless user experiences. Popular services like E-commerce, streaming platforms stand as examples of the web’s ability to connect people round the entire world.

Hopefully I’ve given you a new insight into the effectiveness of the web and its services and you can leave here with a new found appreciation for these technologies and the history behind it.
